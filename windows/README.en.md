# Codex Dream Skin Manager for Windows

Open `CodexDreamSkinManager.exe` to browse themes, import images or videos, edit appearance, and apply or restore skins. Windows and macOS share the React interface and Node business core; WPF/WebView2 provides the native window and file dialogs.

Download the x64 installer or portable ZIP from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xxloocee/Codex-Dream-Skin-Manager/releases). Windows 10/11, .NET Framework 4.8 and WebView2 Evergreen Runtime are required. The package includes Node.js. Extract the complete portable package before opening the EXE. The installer creates shortcuts and registers `dreamskin://` links.

Select a theme to preview it, then choose Apply. Importing or saving a theme alone does not change Codex. The manager asks before a required Codex restart. Pause, resume, reset and restore are available in the shared interface. Use Reconnect if the backend disconnects; accepted operations are not automatically replayed.

User themes and runtime state are under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CodexDreamSkin`; language preferences use `language.txt` in that directory. The runtime connects to official Codex over local CDP without modifying its binaries.

## Build from source

Install Node.js 22.22.2 with its LICENSE and .NET SDK 8, then run from the repository root:

```powershell
npm ci
.\build.ps1
```

The output is `build/CodexDreamSkinManager`. `build.ps1` calls `hosts/windows/assemble-shared.ps1` to assemble the shared UI/core, native host, Node and platform resources directly from source. It does not run tests. Packaging uses `tools/package-release.ps1` and `tools/package-installer.ps1`.

`windows/scripts` contains platform operations for process discovery, Codex startup, theme publication, decoding and appearance restoration. Theme editing and library operations belong to `core/`; common injection code belongs to `runtime/` and is generated into platform packages.

The manager invokes Windows PowerShell 5.1 with process-scoped `RemoteSigned` and sets console and pipeline output to UTF-8 without BOM through its shared entry point. It does not change the system code page or the user's global execution policy. It removes download zone markers only from bundled `windows/scripts/*.ps1` files before platform operations; user-selected files are excluded. Scripts containing Chinese use UTF-8 with BOM.

The shared core handles downloads, package imports, deduplication and preset configuration merging. Platform startup initializes a missing active theme and validates the existing snapshot; it does not remove old presets, migrate the library or merge library settings back into the active theme.
